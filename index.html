                    <div class="heading">Aperture</div>
                    Aperture refers to the opening of a lens's diaphragm through which light passes. It is calibrated in f/stops and is generally written as numbers such as 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11 and 16.

                    <div class="heading">Shutter Speed</div>
                    Shutter speed is a measurement of the time the shutter is open, shown in seconds or fractions of a second: 1 s, 1/2 s, 1/4 s … 1/250 s, 1/ 500 s, etc. ... In other words, the faster the shutter speed the easier it is to photograph the subject without blur and “freeze” motion and the smaller the effects of camera shake.

                    <div class="heading">ISO</div>
                    In digital photography, the term ISO refers to the image sensor's sensitivity to light. The lower the number, the less sensitive the image sensor is to light.
